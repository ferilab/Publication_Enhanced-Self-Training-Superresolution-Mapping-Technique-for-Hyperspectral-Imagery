Abstract:
An efficient superresolution technique through spatial-spectral data fusion for hyperspectral (HS) imagery is proposed in this letter. The spatial and spectral contents of an HS image are extracted using a linear mixture model and a fully constrained least squares unmixing technique. These data are then combined using a spatial correlation model through a learning-based superresolution mapping (SRM) algorithm. The proposed spatial correlation model realistically simulates a mapping model between the low-resolution (LR) HS image and its subsampled version ( LR2 HS image) to train the designed SRM algorithm for mapping from the LR to high resolution. The experiments on real HS images validate the accuracy and low complexity of the proposed autonomous technique for key information detection in HS imagery.
